# Relational Toolkit
## An Archive of Tools from Jon Ossoff for U.S. Senate 

This GitHub repository holds code utilized for the relational programs on Jon Ossoff's run-off campaign for U.S. Senate. It's organized into folders by project -- for the volunteer program chaser's tracker, the CM dashboard, the Reach data flow, and the daily early-vote report emails.

The `views` folder contains SQL queries for views we utilized frequently across every project.
